## 📌 Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced research environments, academics and professionals are overwhelmed by the growing volume of scientific literature. Tasks like identifying relevant research papers, summarizing content, and organizing citations are **time-consuming, repetitive**, and often inefficient.

There is a **need for an intelligent system** that can:
- Understand research intent.
- Retrieve relevant scholarly content.
- Generate concise summaries.
- Assist in citation and hypothesis generation.

---

## ✅ Solution Overview

We propose an AI-powered **Research Agent** that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to automate and optimize core research activities. The agent is designed to:

- Accept natural language research queries.
- Retrieve and summarize relevant academic papers from trusted sources.
- Suggest hypotheses and auto-generate structured sections of research papers.
- Format references in IEEE, APA, and other styles.
- Identify research trends, gaps, and potential collaborators.
